# TempPi v0.2
#### by Artem B.

This project is designed for **Raspberry Pi Pico** and uses **BME-280** module to gather data, a **0.96 OLED display** to show it and a **PCF8523 RTC** module to keep track of date and time.

Drivers used in this project are: **BME-280**, **PCF8523 RTC** and **SSD1306** (from Adafruit).

For now this station is set to track British Summer Time **(BST)**, uses Celsius **(Â°C)** and uses **American date and time notation** (e.g. 4/3/2021, April 3, 2021). You are welcome to download the code and edit it.

CircuitPython version: **adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-6.2.0-rc.0**

Schematic will be coming soon.

Thanks for your interest!
